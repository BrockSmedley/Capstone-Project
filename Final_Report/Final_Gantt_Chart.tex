\paragraph{Final Development Schedule Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item\textbf{Task 1:} Ordered hardware, and most hardware was received.\\
	\item\textbf{Task 2:} Became acquainted with TX2 \& development kit, JetPack 3.1 SDK, GStreamer, and produced single video output. \\
	\item\textbf{Task 3:} Attempted to produce multi-camera output with TX2, development kit, Auvidea J20, and Raspberry Pi camera setup. \\
	\item\textbf{Task 4:} Attempted to produce multi-camera output with TX2, Auvidea M110 motherboard, Auvidea J106 board, and Raspberry Pi camera setup. \\
	\item\textbf{Task 5:} Received the remaining hardware ordered for project. Produced two and three-camera output with TX2, Connect Tech Inc Spacely Carrier, and Leopard Imaging camera setup. \\
	\item\textbf{Task 6:} Developed two-camera stitched video output, two and three-camera tiled output, and latency estimates. \\
	\item\textbf{Task 7:} Attempted to reduce latency issues in stitched video output, and produced scripts to build TX2 from scratch. \\
