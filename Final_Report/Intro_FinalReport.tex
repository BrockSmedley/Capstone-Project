% 2-3 paragraphs, minimum

Our project is required to provide a video output at near real-time from a 
multi-camera input utilizing an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 system-on-module (SoM).
Another hardware requirement established by our client is that the cameras used in
the project utilize a CSI (cameral serial interface) for its input specification.   
The software produced is requested to perform image processing and edge computing on the 
camera input to display a stitched and tiled video output. 

The project's client, Carlo Tianna of Rockwell Collins has established size, weight, 
power, and cost (SWaP-C) contraints for a few reasons. 
The project's application is for UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) and VR/AR, and therefore 
the hardware for the project must be light-weight and compact and have a low power 
draw. Our cost constraint is met by the hardware is using an off-the-shelf SoM, 
carrier board, and cameras, and the software developed is using free open-source 
programming libraries, multimedia framework, and operating system. 

The importance of our project comes from the cost constraint established by our client.
