        \item Need to modify the document and re-assign work for each one.
    \end{itemize}  
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\noindent\textbf{Summary:}\\
    \noindent Since the TX2 is a new device, it is more difficult to find information and apply on 
    it. It is better to back up some files as well after we would be done on kernel building. \\

    \vspace{-0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The BPS comes with spacely carrier board works well and activate the cameras.
    \end{itemize} 
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\textbf{Problems:}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The CSI2 ports on the spacely carrier only support 3 cameras for TX2. (May influence stretch goal).

    progress, the group has reached the alpha demo target and need to determine what to do for beta demo 
    in the week 10. \\
\end{adjustwidth} 

\paragraph{Week 9}
\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}\textbf{Plans:}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}

    \vspace{-0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The group worked on the openCV and tried to stitch two camera inputs together. 
        \item The built-in function Stitch works too slow to approach near real-time processing.
    \end{itemize}  
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\noindent\textbf{Summary:}\\
    \noindent The original stitch function in OpenCV doesn't work well in this project. After searching for 
    more information about pano view video, the group has a briefly understanding to move on write video 
    stitching function. \\
\end{adjustwidth} 

\paragraph{Week 10}
\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}\textbf{Plans:}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The group still have some missing requirements to reach the goals for alpha demo.
        \item The TA allowed us to postpone it to the second week of Spring term.

        \item Test on the sample for the features.
        \item Test on the latency of camera input, and the result seems great for near real-time goal.
    \end{itemize} 
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\textbf{Problems:}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Stitching algorithm is a little complex and need more research on it to do this in openCV.
        \item Require extra libraries of openCV to reach this.
        \item Need new things for mounting the system since the cameras are changed to IMX274.
    \end{itemize}  
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\noindent\textbf{Summary:}\\
    \noindent In order to prepare for the coming alpha demo and beta demo in the beginning of the Spring term,
     we now focus on the least goals: mounting and stitching in better way. On the other hand, since the final 
     comes next week, we start to discuss on the distribution for presentation. \\

        \item Keeping working on stitching images from two cameras.
        \item Contacting with teammates to check meeting time for this term.
    \end{itemize} 
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\textbf{Progress:}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Try to write our own stitching program.
    \end{itemize} 
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\textbf{Problems:}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Need to try on coding if transform homography works well.
    \end{itemize}  
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\noindent\textbf{Summary:}\\
    \noindent We keep working from the last term to improve the latency issue from image processing. Also 
    to see if there is any other part can improve the latency. \\

\paragraph{Week 2}
\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}\textbf{Plans:}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Have meeting with the client and to see what we still need to work on.
        \item Try to improve the latency.
    \end{itemize} 
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\textbf{Progress:}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Have the capture range and to compute the portion to determine specific number to stitching images.
    \end{itemize} 
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\textbf{Problems:}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the client suggest that we can simply cut images in portion and then stitch instead of complex funciton.
    \end{itemize}  
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\noindent\textbf{Summary:}\\
    \noindent In order to have some progression on latency, we had test the real frame rate for the video 
    capturing, and it was almost the same as what we set up in the pipeline, 30 frames per second. Also, I 
    measured the range a camera capture and expect to compute the stitching function. \\

\paragraph{Week 3}
\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}\textbf{Plans:}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To set up the second TX2 module and test if it could speed up camera capturing with CUDA.
    \end{itemize} 
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\textbf{Progress:}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Have the base frame to mounting cameras, and still need something to connect the carrier board.
    \end{itemize} 
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\textbf{Problems:}
    \vspace{-0.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Could not run OpenCV on the second module.
    \end{itemize}  
    \vspace{-0.3cm}\noindent\textbf{Summary:}\\
    \noindent The project is already there, and we need plans with more details for Expo. At the same time, 
    since the latency of image capturing is the most important part in our project, we also still try to improve 
    it with another board. \\
