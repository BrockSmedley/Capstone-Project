\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}

Our project is required to provide a video output at near real-time from a 
multi-camera input utilizing an NVIDIA Jetson TX1 or TX2 system-on-module (SoM). 
The software produced will perform image processing and edge computing on the 
camera input to display a visually enhanced and stitched video output. 
Size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) requirements for the project are due 
to its application being for UAS and VR/AR, and from our system utilizing a 
mass-produced SoM, particularly the Jetson TX1 or TX2.  

\subsection{Scope}
 
Software scope/requirements here. (Take pixel streams, do the hokey pokey, and 
we have low latency, wicked fast video at near real-time speed.)
 
Application specific hardware and software are vital for the project due the the 
system requirements and constraints of the project.
The NVIDIA Jetson TX1 and TX2 run on an Ubuntu based Linux for Tegra (L4T) operating 
system created specifically for producing customized imaging, installed on a 
GPU-accelerated dual-core CPU with dual Image Signal Processors (ISPs). 
NVIDIA provides the Jetson Software Development Pack (JetPack) 3.1 which has L4T 28.1 
and is capable of supporting a multitude of multimedia and image processing API. 
The cameras will utilize the most widely used camera interface for mobile applications, 
MIPI CSI-2, which is capable of supporting 1080p, 4k, and 8k video. 
A carrier board will connect the cameras to the Jetson TX1 or TX2 that also provides 
additional application-specific interfaces and peripherals. 


\subsection{Overview}

\section{Week 1}

\subsection{Summary}

The first week of the term project choices were presented and preferences were
submitted. No project specific progress was made.

\section{Week 2}

\subsection{Summary}

The group was assigned the project specified and immediately initiated coordinating 
with the project's client, Carlo Tiana of Rockwell Collins, to hold the initial 
meeting. The group shared their schedules on Google Calendar to coordinate meetings, 
and performed preliminary research on the topics mentioned in the project's title.

   The group was assigned to the project and members were introduced to one another. 
   Contact was initiated with the project's client and a meeting was scheduled. 
   Research began on the topics surrounding the project's title to prepare 
   for our initial meeting occurring next week.
