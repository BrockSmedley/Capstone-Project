\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}

This document is a general description of design concepts that will be used for our 
multi-camera, SoM based, real-time video processing for UAS and VR/AR applications. 
It is a reference to guide the development of our product.  \\

\subsection{Scope}

Our product will receive input from multiple cameras and then provide a video output at 
near real-time. Our software will receive the pixel data from the cameras and format 
the pixel streams so that image processing can occur. Image processing will then stitch 
the multiple streams of pixels being received to create a combined output. The software 
will be flashed onto the NVIDIA TX1/2, which receives input from the carrier 
board that is connected to the cameras. \\

\subsection{Overview}

The development and design of our product requires: hardware interface and system 
architecture, receiving camera input and formatting for image processing, and image 
processing for video output. The structure of our document reflects these three areas 
of our software required for our product. \\

\section{System Overview}  

\subsection{Identified Stakeholders and Design Concerns}

Rockwell Collins is the primary customer of this product. The company provides 
engineering products in the aviation industry for commercial and military customers. 
Rockwell Collins is the primary user of the product and it is contributing 
to the development of a system that will be used in UAS and VR/AR applications. \\

\subsection{Hardware Context}

The hardware used in our product will be the NVIDIA Jetson TX1/2 as our SoM, 
a carrier board, and cameras. The input from cameras will be transferred through 
carrier boards, and the TX1/2 will format and process the input to produce a 
video output. The software we're developing will be on the TX1/2. \\

\subsection{Software Context}

The software pieces in this project include: GStreamer for transforming video input 
from CSI for image processing, and OpenGL development environment for image processing 
to produce the video output. The pipeline feature in GStreamer will reduce 
cost on time and storage to help achieve near real-time image processing. The OpenGL 
will stitch input images from GStreamer and print the output to the display device. \\
