\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
Our project is required to provide a video output at near real-time from a 
multi-camera input utilizing an NVIDIA Jetson TX1 or TX2 system-on-module (SoM). 
The software produced will perform image processing and edge computing on the 
camera input to display a visually enhanced and stitched video output. 
Size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) requirements for the project are due 
to its application being for UAS and VR/AR, and from our system utilizing a 
mass-produced SoM, particularly the Jetson TX1 or TX2. \\

\subsection{Scope}

Application specific hardware and software are vital for the project due the the 
system requirements and constraints of the project.
The NVIDIA Jetson TX2 runs on an Ubuntu based Linux for Tegra (L4T) operating 
system created specifically for producing customized imaging, installed on a 
GPU-accelerated dual-core CPU with dual Image Signal Processors (ISPs). \\

L4T, being an Ubuntu variant, provides a friendly development interface with 
access to a large repository of additional software.NVIDIA provides the Jetson 
Software Development Pack (JetPack) 3.1 which has L4T 28.1 
and is capable of supporting a multitude of multimedia and image processing 
application program interfaces (APIs). Jetpack 
is installed on an Ubuntu host computer and is then flashed to the TX2's memory, and 
selected libraries are then installed when the TX2 is self-sustaining. \\

The cameras will utilize the most widely used camera interface for mobile applications, 
MIPI CSI-2, which is capable of supporting 1080p, 4k, and 8k video. 
A carrier board will connect the cameras to the Jetson TX2 that also provides 
additional application-specific interfaces and peripherals. \\

The software materials for this project will support the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and 
be able to produce stitched images from cameras in near real-time. The media inputs 
from cameras are sent through  the CSI and carrier board, and then arrive at our 
software in the TX2 in raw-pixel form. The pixels are then processed through our 
GStreamer pipelines for distributing and transforming their data to the image 
processor. OpenCV libraries in our software is used to access the data in the image 
processor to produce our desired image output. The process avoids writing and 
therefore reading our input data to storage to reduce latency. The image processing 
software will utilize the images from media stream and produce streaming video 
to the display device.  \\

\subsection{Overview}

This document provides a recap of the progress made on our project through the first half
of the Spring 2018 term. The group so far has been focused on \\

EDIT:
getting the TX2 module to produce a multi-camera output with a CSI (Camera Serial Interface) module attached to the TX2 module, which allows us to connect multiple cameras to the device.
Shu-Ping Chien and W Keith Striby Jr have primarily been working in tandem so their 
contributions will be similar. Brock has spent most of the term doing research about the software we use so that it may later be scripted in order to save development time. The following 
sections reflect this progress with each group member explaining where their involvement 
with the project currently is, work remaining, problems experienced 
with solutions if applicable, and images of the hardware setups. \\
