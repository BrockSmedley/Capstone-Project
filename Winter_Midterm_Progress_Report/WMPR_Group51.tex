\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
Our project is required to provide a video output at near real-time from a 
multi-camera input utilizing an NVIDIA Jetson TX1 or TX2 system-on-module (SoM). 
The software produced will perform image processing and edge computing on the 
camera input to display a visually enhanced and stitched video output. 
Size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) requirements for the project are due 
to its application being for UAS and VR/AR, and from our system utilizing a 
mass-produced SoM, particularly the Jetson TX1 or TX2. \\

\subsection{Scope}
Application specific hardware and software are vital for the project due the the 
system requirements and constraints of the project.
The NVIDIA Jetson TX1 and TX2 run on an Ubuntu based Linux for Tegra (L4T) operating 
system created specifically for producing customized imaging, installed on a 
GPU-accelerated dual-core CPU with dual Image Signal Processors (ISPs). 

L4T, being an Ubuntu variant, provides a friendly development interface with access to a 
large repository of additional software.
NVIDIA provides the Jetson Software Development Pack (JetPack) 3.1 which has L4T 28.1 
and is capable of supporting a multitude of multimedia and image processing API. Jetpack 
is installed on an Ubuntu host and then used to flash the TX2's memory with L4T and 
selected libraries.

The cameras will utilize the most widely used camera interface for mobile applications, 
MIPI CSI-2, which is capable of supporting 1080p, 4k, and 8k video. 
A carrier board will connect the cameras to the Jetson TX1 or TX2 that also provides 
additional application-specific interfaces and peripherals.

The software materials for this project will support the NVIDIA Jetson TX1 and TX2 and 
be able to produce fused images from cameras in near real-time. The media inputs from 
cameras through CSI will be captured in pipelines for distribution and transformation 
then sent to the image processor, and the process avoids to reload our input datas to 
reduce latency. The image processing software will utilize the images from media stream 
and produce stitched images as output to the display device.  \\

\subsection{Overview}
This document provides a recap of the progress made on our project during the 
Winter 2018 term. \\
Update this section \\
In addition to completing required documents and assignments the group primarily 
researched on hardware and software solutions necessary to complete the project 
successfully. Once hardware research was completed and procurement started the group 
began researching more into the design and development of software. The following 
sections reflect this progress with detailed weekly summaries and retrospectives. \\
